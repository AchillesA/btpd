1.0 - TODO

Better code for missing c99 int types. Evil OgreBSD!
Fix spelling errors
Should be able to listen on IPv6 too
Calculate number of bytes left better
Should pick random pieces, not rarest, at download start
Man pages and other documentation.
Do checksums in child process.
Send keep alives
Convert file names from UTF-8 to user locale
Much, much,  better cli. Both code and usage wise.
Close connections to seeders if we are seeding
Better data structures
General code cleanup, esp. the cli
Improve build scripts
Intelligent logging
Better handling of unresponsive trackers
Send multiple have messages instead of bitfield, when it's better
Bitfields could be handled as a whole in policy.c.
