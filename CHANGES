btpd 0.2:
---------

Misc:
- A new way to do rate limiting.
- Compact mode is now used when talking to the tracker.

Bug fixes:
- A buffer was too small by four bytes, causing a buffer overflow
  on the heap in certain conditions.
- An iteration over a list was unsafe and could cause a crash.
- Unloading a torrent didn't kill peers in handshake for that torrent,
  and a crash was possible when the handshake finished.
- The counter for uploaded data was updated too early.
- Fixed illegal operator for test(1) in configure.
