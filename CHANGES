btpd-0.6:
---------

Misc:
- Set an upper limit on how much data a peer can request at once.
  This protects from running out of memory because of a greedy peer.
- End game is more efficient and uses much less memory.

btpd-0.5:
---------

Bug fixes:
- The bitfield could be sent too late. This could cause the receiving
  peer to close the connection.

btpd-0.4:
---------

Misc:
- The 0.1 rate limiter is back. It runs at a configurable hz now.
- Added "--bw-hz" option to btpd.
- Multiple have messages can be sent in place of a bitfield.
- If btpd can't write to a peer for 60s, it will be disconnected.

Bug fixes:
- A calculation error made btpd buggy with small torrents.
  This caused strange crashes and many reports on bad hashes in the log.
- The bitfield was sent too early. A peer could miss pieces btpd got
  while the peer was in handshake.
- Some situations in end game or with bad hashes could cause a crash.

btpd-0.3:
---------

Misc:
- New download strategy.
- Pipe ten requests instead of five.
- "-d" option added to btpd.
- "--with-warn" option added to configure. The default is now
  to compile with warnings off.

Bug fixes:
- It was possible for blocks to remain marked as busy when a peer
  choked or was lost, causing a piece download to wait until end game.
- The peer wanted level could get too high during end game.

btpd 0.2:
---------

Misc:
- A new way to do rate limiting.
- Compact mode is now used when talking to the tracker.

Bug fixes:
- A buffer was too small by four bytes, causing a buffer overflow
  on the heap in certain conditions.
- An iteration over a list was unsafe and could cause a crash.
- Unloading a torrent didn't kill peers in handshake for that torrent,
  and a crash was possible when the handshake finished.
- The counter for uploaded data was updated too early.
- Fixed illegal operator for test(1) in configure.
